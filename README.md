this contains code of my project
"I developed a SMART Water Quality Monitoring System using Arduino, which is designed to measure key water quality parameters—like pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen—in real-time. The goal of the project is to provide a portable, cost-effective solution for monitoring water quality in environments like natural water bodies, aquaculture farms, or industrial water management settings.
